Refactoring
In AddRecordDialog on line 129 added a method to check if fields were empty instead of being repeated.
Made a JLabelFactory class to create JLabels to stop over encumbered code in other classes.
In EmployeeDetails line 989 created switch statement to replace If statements as if else statement didn’t look great in the class.
EmployeeDetails 240 used JLabelFactory.	
EmployeeDetails 699 checking if empty.	
EmployeeDetails at line 650 used regex to replace charAts.
Variable names were all very good and didn’t ned to be changed
